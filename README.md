<h1>Hi you beautiful human being ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>My name is Janne and I'm honored to see you here. I'm a web designer so unfortunately I'm not much of a cotrybutor here in GitHub. Anycase it's more than cool these kinds of places excists.</p>
<p>So I work for myself in a company called <a href="https://www.janneparri.fi">Janne Parri Oy</a>. Yeh I now, quite original name. I do mostly <a href="https://www.janneparri.fi/nettisivut-yritykselle">websites</a> from start to finish. <a href="https://www.janneparri.fi/webflow-sivut">Webflow</a> is my jam and honestly I'm quite excited about it after two years of use.</p>
<p>You might be a hard core developer and in that case I salute you! I've scrached the surface of some languages but what realy gets me going are all those applications you get to make. I'm just saying this to express my gratitude towards you! In these forums I migth be the "noob" but this noob is way better of with all the help I've gotten.</p>
